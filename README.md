## Issues
If you encounter any issue during your playthrough, either with the Modpack itself or the Server Pack, make sure to report it either here on [GitHub](https://github.com/EvergoodTeam/Evergood/issues) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/k2P68Y8) in the correct channel (#issues)

## Notes
- Files provided in the "Client" folder are to be shared between the Modpack and the Server Pack (except the "Local" folder)

- Files provided in the "Server" folder are only used by the Serverpack

- The "Server" and "Client" folder do **NOT** provide the "mods" folder, since that would just be redistribution of someone else's property without permission on a third party platform that isn't Curseforge.

You can obtain a copy of the "mods" folder either by downloading the Modpack or the Server Pack from [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/evergood/files).
The latter will contain no client mods.
